# CircuitPython

My CircuitPython assignments
## Hello CircuitPython (and Metro and Mu)
### Objective

### Lessons Learned
In this assignment, I learned that the easiest way to code an LED is with a PWM (pulse width moderator) pin.  PWM pins change the percentage of time that the LED is on (duty cycle), which makes it appear as if the brightness is fading in and out.  I also learned the basics of CircuitPython coding language, such as the fact that you have to import modules for most functions, and that while True takes the place of void loop ().
